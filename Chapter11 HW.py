#Question 1
"""What is the Python interpreterâ€™s response to the following? >>> list(range(10, 0, -2))
The three arguments to the range function are start, stop, and step, respectively. In this
example, start is greater than stop. What happens if start < stop and step < 0? Write a
rule for the relationships among start, stop, and step."""

"""
[start+(1*step), start+(2*step), start+(3*step) ... ] until (n*step) = start 
where n is a whole number integer and n = |start - stop| / step
"""

#Question 2
"Consider this fragment of code:

import turtle

tess = turtle.Turtle()
alex = tess
alex.color("hotpink")
Does this fragment create one or two turtle instances? Does setting the
color of alex also change the color of tess? Explain in detail."
